# Section 5 - Bulletproof system upgrades

In this section we will modify the image that we created in Section 1 by removing and adding packages to the definition.

  >**Note**
  >
  > We will remove (intentionally) some of the packages that are, in fact, needed to make the manual overwrite prevention system that we have seen in Section 3 work (such as `python3-inotify`). We will do it in order to demonstrate how the system will realize that we made a mistake excluding those packages and how it will rolback to the previous image version were those packages were present.   

1. Open a Terminal en the edge system and run `watch "rpm-ostree upgrade --preview"` command as root to verify that there are no system updates available and to watch changes while we publish the new image in the following steps. Keep this CLI Terminal visible.


```bash
Every 2.0s: rpm-ostree upgrade --preview                                                                                                                        edge-848bcd4d1537: Tue Jan  9 11:34:51 2024

Note: --check and --preview may be unreliable.  See https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/1579
No updates available
```

2. Open `device-edge-images/production-image-definition.yaml` in Gitea and review the `builder_compose_pkgs` packages. Remove the `python3-inotify` packages and include an additional one (ie. `zsh`), so we are simulating that someone wants to add a package but, when he reviews the image definition, he thinks that the `python3-inotify` package can be safely removed (which is not the case) too.

```bash

builder_blueprint_name: rhde-image-student1

    groups: ["users", "wheel"]
  services:
    enabled: ["microshift"]
  firewall.services:
    enabled: ["80/tcp", "443/tcp", "6443/tcp"]
```

  >**Note**
  >
  > You can find Blueprints for versions v2 and v3 on `device-edge-images/examples` in Gitea. 


3. As soon as you change the image definition you can open the AAP and show the Workflow running in the "Jobs" page which will use the Image Builder service to create the new Red Hat Device Edge.

  >**Note**
  >
  > Again, this can take a while depending on the machine resources.


4. Meanwhile the image is being created, open a new CLi terminal in the edge device as root user and show the Greenboot scripts and configuration files in `ls /etc/greenboot/`. There you will see how Greenboot configuration has mainly 4 different parts:

* `greenboot.conf` configuration file where we can setup, for example, the number of boot attempts before marking a system as failed
* scripts under `green.d` directory that are executed when a sucesfull upgrade is completed
* scripts under `red.d` directory that are executed when the system upgrade failed
* scripts under `check` directory where the health check  scripts are located. Those will make the system rolback (if they are located under `required.d`) or just show a Warning message (the ones under `wanted.d`).


We have the `01-check-packages.sh` health-check scipt located under `required.d` (which means that if it fails during an upgrade, the system will rollback to the previous image version). This script checks if `python3-inotify` packages are installed in the system and if not it will fail.

  >**Note**
  >
  > It's important to note that, due to simplicity, here we are performing this simple check, but these scripts could also be used for much more interesting points such as monitor the status of the running applications on top of the system or checking the connectivity from external systems.


```bash
#!/bin/bash

if ! rpm -q python3-inotify &>/dev/null; then
  echo "Error: python3-inotify is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

echo "python3-inotify is installed."
```

  >**Note**
  >
  > If you deployed Microshift you will find an auto-generated required script named `40_microshift_running_check.sh` to check the Microshift status. 


You can also show that there is an additional script (`01-slack-notification.sh`) configured in Gitea under `red.d` which will send a message to Slack in case of a system upgrade failure.


5. Check "Jobs" page in AAP until the "Compose Image" Job finish. Then click the "New Edge Device Image" Workflow Job, click the "Publish Image Approval" box and finally click on "Approve" (button left) to let the workflow progress

![Image workflow](../images/rhde_gitops_image-workflow.png)


6. Once the Worflow has finished publishing the new image, you will see in the edge device opened CLI Terminal that there was a change indicating that there is an upgrade available. If you want to have a better view just close the `watch` command and directly run `rpm-ostree upgrade --preview`. That will show the changes introduced with that new version.

  >**Note**
  >
  > Remember that you will see not only the packages that you removed/installed, but also all the required dependencies.

 ```

7. You have two options now. You can perform the upgrade manually from that same edge device CLI terminal, or you can use the pre-configured "OSTree Upgrade" Workflow Template in AAP that will upgrade all devices contained in the inventory (in our case just one...). If you choose to run manually the Template, a new Workflow Job will be launched. It will execute the "Run command" Job and then wait for "Reboot approval". 

If you follow the CLI option, you can run `sudo rpm-ostree upgrade` as root user in the edge system and that will download the system image changes. Then you will need to reboot your system (`systemctl reboot`) to move the system to the new image version. 


  >**Note**
  >
  > Ostree images work like your IOS or Android phones, where you reboot to use a new upgraded image, so we will need to reboot our system. 

No matter if you are using the AAP Job or the CLI, before performing the upgrade be sure that you are showing the edge device Console terminal to see the device booting. This terminal is not an SSH terminal but the actual video output of the system. If you are using VMs for your demo/workshop you can do it just by opening the VM's console but if you are using physical servers you will need either an external screen connected to your device or a Video Capture Card (as the one shown in the [Recommended Hardware Section](README.md#recommended-hardware) to show the output on your laptop.



8. Once you launch the reboot, you will see in the Console output this behaviour:

  1. System shutdown
  2. System boots and chooses `ostree:0` on the Brub menu. That means that it selects the most recent version of the OSTree image, so the one recently published.


![Grub ostree 0](../images/rhde_gitops_grub-0.png)


  3. System finishes booting. At that point the Greenboot scripts will start being checked and, since we removed some required packages by our script, it will fail. That will trigger after one minute or so a new reboot again
  4. System will try to boot again from `ostree:0` but again the Greenboot script will fail and then the third reboot will take place
  5. This time the system will rollback to the previous image (`ostree:1` in our case) where the `python-inotify` package was available, so this time the Greenboot scripts won't fail and the reboot won't be trigger again.


9. You can show how the `01-slack-notification.sh` script located in the `red.d` greenboot directory was executed by showing the messages in your Slack channel.

![Slack upgrade fail](../images/rhde_gitops_slack_update.png)


10. After the third boot SSH to the edge device again and show the warning message that says that a fallback action was taken in the system:


```bash
[ansible@edge-manager-local ~]$ ssh <edge device ip>
ansible@<edge device ip>'s password: 
Boot Status is GREEN - Health Check SUCCESS
FALLBACK BOOT DETECTED! Default rpm-ostree deployment has been rolled back.
Health check logs from previous boot:
Script '01-check-packages.sh' FAILURE (exit code '1'). Continuing...
```

You can also check the Journal and show the errors with this command: `journalctl | grep 01-check-packages.sh | grep Error`

11. Show how the system still detects that there is a system upgrade with `rpm-ostree upgrade --check`, because we are actually using the "old image":


```bash
[root@edge-848bcd4d1537 greenboot]# rpm-ostree upgrade --check
1 metadata, 0 content objects fetched; 153 B transferred in 0 seconds; 0 bytes content written
Note: --check and --preview may be unreliable.  See https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/issues/1579

```

  >**Note**
  >
  > This output is for `rpm-ostree upgrade --check` not `rpm-ostree upgrade --preview`. The difference is that with `--check` we hide the package change datails

12. Do not perform again the upgrade since you will hit the same behaviour, first create a third image where we add `zsh` but keep `python-inotify` using this Blueprint:


```bash

builder_blueprint_name: rhde-image-student1
builder_request_timeout: 300

  services:
    enabled: ["microshift"]
  firewall.services:
    enabled: ["80/tcp", "443/tcp", "6443/tcp"]
```

13. After creating and publishing the new image perform the system upgrade again (either with the CLI on the edge device or using the "	OSTree Upgrade" Job in AAP) and show how this time the system was sucesfully upgraded.



## TIP: Reducing the demo/workshop time by pre-creating images in advance

Creating those two additional images takes time. If you feel that you cannot fill that time with something useful or you think you won't have time to invest on that activity you can pre-create the images thanks to a trick that was introduced in the lab when it was deployed.

If you check `device-edge-images/production-image-deploy.yml` file in Gitea you can see that, by default, we are "publishing" the last image created by the image builder, but we can change the behaviour following this steps:

1. Create the base image (Section 1)
2. Create the upgrade where we remove `python-inotify` and add `zsh`. You can use the "Compose Image" or just use the GitOps approach or the Workflow without approving the publishing (it's just to save time, it does not affect if you publish in any case)
3. Create the second upgrade where we include `` again 
4. Change the `device-edge-images/production-image-deploy.yml` to `production_image_version: "0.0.1"`. That will trigger the "Publish Image" Job in AAP.

At that time you will have the base image published. You can go through the different Sections and now, when you reach this Section where you have to perform the upgrade you can just change to `production_image_version: "0.0.2"` and that will publish the second image (first upgrade without `python-inotify`) without having to create the image, because it's already there in the system. You can repeat that step with `production_image_version: "0.0.3"` for the final image.

Just only remember that you configured a fixed image version and not the `latest` since if you create a new image and let the usual Workflow Job publish that image, you will end up creating that new image but not publishing it.
