## Step 1 - Reviewing Applied Controller Configuration
In the Ansible Controller web interface, we should now see our stated configuration applied.

For example, job templates:
![Controller Job Templates](../.images/controller-job-templates.png)

And our new credential:
![Controller Credentials](../.images/controller-credentials.png)

The host that corresponds to our network appliance:
![Controller Host](../.images/controller-appliance-host.png)

This confirms our integration between procedural and declarative tooling.
