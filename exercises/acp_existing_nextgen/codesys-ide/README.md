# Rockwell Automation's Factorytalk View SE Virtual Machine
These exercises will show how to build a FactoryTalk View SE HMI from Rockwell using Windows virtual machines on top of the platform. Automation will be used to complete the installation and setup. In addition, the VM contains a setup that will be used to visual code being executed in another group. 

Since this workload requires infrastructure AND automation to fully deploy, the gitops functionally will be used to both deploy and maintain the infrastructure, to load the necessary automation into Controller, and then to run it.

## Sections
The exercises are broken up into four main sections:
1. Create Infrastructure via GitOps
2. Create VM with FactoryTalk View SE
3. Investigate Results
