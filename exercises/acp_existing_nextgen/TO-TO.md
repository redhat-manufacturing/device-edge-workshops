# What's Left to Do
~~1. Switch to using ODF, since gp3-csi replication between AZs is very slow~~
2. Add ArgoCD link to student pages
~~3. Add virtual machine imports/templates to setup~~
4. Add example virtual machines to team namespaces
~~5. Create student users login via htpasswd~~
6. Give student users permissions on team namespaces
