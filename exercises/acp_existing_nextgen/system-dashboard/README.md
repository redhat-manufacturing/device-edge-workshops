# System Dashboard
These exercises will focus on collecting availability and performance information from key components of the system, and then displaying them on a dashboard.

This exerience will use declarative tooling, but it will not use procedural tooling, as everything can be declaratively configured and deployed.

This experience is more "open-ended" in nature: recommendations will be given for what to configure the metrics stack to track, but dashboard design is up to the student or team executing the steps.

## Sections
The exercises are broken up into four main sections:
1. Create Infrastructure via GitOps
2. Create Active Directory Automation
3. Configure Controller via GitOps
4. Investigate Results

Exercises
* [1.1 - Initializing Helm Chart](1.1-initializing-chart/)
